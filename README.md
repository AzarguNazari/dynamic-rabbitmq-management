# dynamic-rabbitmq-management
RabbitMQ has an option of configuring the RabbitMQ management through `definitions.json`. In this project, I worked to create users, queues, exchange and bindings dynamically through spring boot and running it on rabbitmq image.

## How to run it?
- Simply by `docker-compose up`
